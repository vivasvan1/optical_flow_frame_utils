This repo contains code for reading and writing .flo, .pfm, .png, .bin, .raw, .ppm and .jpg

All the credits for the code goes to https://github.com/princeton-vl/RAFT/blob/master/core/utils/frame_utils.py

Thank you so much.

I am simply uploading as a python package for easier use for visualizing for my IPython.
